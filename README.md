# miRNA-Seq
Includes the Linux slurm codes and R analyses for complete pipeline analysis for the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Study

The Dataset from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Study contained miRNA sequences prepared with adapters not automatically removed by trimgalore. Using cutadapt was required to remove them via barcodes which were provided in the supporting documents of the study
R code aimed at finding correlation between the two chosen groups: No Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Patients. In addition, it was looking for statistically significant differences in genome sequences to explore the possibility of a correlation of certain genes and Alzheimer's.
